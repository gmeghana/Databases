Criteria Met:
insertActorDirector.php(Page I1) - Page that let's users add actor and director information
insertMovieInfo.php(Page I2) - Page that let's users add movie information
insertComments.php(Page I3) - Page that let's users add comments to movies
insertMovieActor.php(Page I4) - Page that let's users add actor to movie relations
insertMovieDirector(Page I5) - Page that let's users add director to movie relations

actorInfo.php(Page B1) - Page that shows actor information and is a game. Users are given a default page and are challenged to find the Tom Hanks page with only clicking links. For example, the default page here is Leonardo DiCaprio where the user will click on a movie (such as "Celebrity") which leads to movieInfo.php page of the Celebrity and then clicks on an actor link. The user goes back and forth between links until they are able to reach the correct page - Tom Hanks. 
movieInfo.php(Page B2) - Page that shows movie information. This page starts the same game in actorInfo with the same challenge to find Tom Hanks, but now the user starts with "Titanic" and has to click through links until they find Tom Hanks. If they succeed, they are a Moviepedia Star!

search.php(Page S1) - Page that lets users search for a movie actor or actress or movie through a keyword search interface

This work was a team effort between Sara Melvin and Meghana Ginjpalli. We used github to share our code as we worked together.
Sara - insertActorDirector.php, insertMovieInfo.php, insertMovieActor.php, insertMovieDirector.php, insertComments.php
Meghana - actorInfo.php, movieInfo.php, search.php, main.html, linksSidebar.html, insertComments.php

Better collaboration:
-Before we were emailing our code back and forth but github made it easy to pass the latest code to one another. We improved from our last project and we hope to continue to improve our github skills. Maybe some branching and forking.
